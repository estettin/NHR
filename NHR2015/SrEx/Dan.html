Dan joined Norman Hecht Research in the Spring of 1996.  He heads up the analysis, consulting and client presentation responsibilities at Norman Hecht Research for both primary research and ratings consulting. These efforts are more than a full-time job as Dan spends a good deal of his time meeting with the company’s prestigious clients throughout the year.  Dan’s strength in ascertaining client needs is matched by his ability to communicate actionable research findings in the most clear and comprehensive manner.  These traits assist client management in achieving their strategic goals.  Dan is often requested to give presentations at client group meetings.  Dan also moderates many focus group discussions for our clients.
